(at least this is how I remember it!)

Added: missing initialiser values in EditorGLCanvas constructor.
Added: 'busy' state for some potentially long operations.
Added: proper invoke method for resource groups dialog.
Added: Initial code for wxPathCellEditor - a customised cell editor for wxGrid.
Added: Initial code for CEGUI resource groups editor dialog module.
Added: Scrollbar support to main editor view.
Added: Support to scroll main view by holding middle mouse button and dragging.
Added: support to load a new source image for an Imageset without affecting the size of already defined image regions.

Removed: broken hack from resource groups dialog involving 'activated' events.

Modified: Various cleanups, warning fixes, simplifications, etc...
Modified: Tweaked code so that changing image file goes a bit quicker on Win32 (seemed ok on linux).
Modified: Changed image scrolling implementation for EditorGLCanvas to ensure the same behaviour on all wxWidgets platforms.
Modified: changed code so that paths are adjusted, and loaded correctly, according to the current default resource group target directory.

Bug Fix: minor issue where changing the background colour only had effect when an imageset was defined and a source image loaded. Mantis #116.
Bug Fix: issue where GLCanvas is not updated unless there is an Imageset open in the editor.  Mantis #115.
Bug Fix: Resolved issue related to casting and multiple inheritance in wxPathCellEditor (switched base class order).
Bug Fix: Changes so that document 'modified' state is handled correctly.
Bug Fix: prevent unrequired event noise when zooming; fixes speed issues on large numbers of regions.
